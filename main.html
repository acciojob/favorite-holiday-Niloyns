<h1>Kolkata</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) is the capital of India's West Bengal state.
      Founded as an East India Company trading post, it was India's capital
      under the British Raj from 1773–1911. Today it’s known for its grand
      colonial architecture, art galleries and cultural festivals. It’s also
      home to Mother House, headquarters of the Missionaries of Charity, founded
      by Mother Teresa, whose tomb is on site.
